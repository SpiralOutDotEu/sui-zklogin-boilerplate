# UI Gallery Feature

## Overview

The UI Gallery is a comprehensive showcase of all atomic design components in our system. It serves as both a design system documentation and a testing ground for components.

## Purpose

- **Developer Reference**: See all available components and their usage
- **Design System Documentation**: Visual examples with code snippets
- **Component Testing**: Interactive examples to test component behavior
- **Design Review**: Ensure consistency across the component library

## Structure

```
src/features/gallery/
├── routes/
│   ├── UIGallery.tsx    # Main gallery component
│   └── index.ts         # Route exports
├── index.ts             # Feature exports
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Features

### Component Organization

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Avatar, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (AccountCard, TransactionDetails, etc.)
- **Organisms**: Complex components (coming soon)

### Interactive Examples

- Live component demonstrations
- Multiple variants and states
- Code snippets for each component
- Responsive design testing

### Navigation

- Section-based navigation
- Quick access to different component categories
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Usage

Access the gallery at `/gallery` route. The gallery is available to all users and doesn't require authentication.

## Adding New Components

When adding new components to the design system:

1. Add the component to the appropriate section in `UIGallery.tsx`
2. Include multiple variants and states
3. Add code examples
4. Test responsiveness
5. Update this documentation if needed

## Styling

The gallery uses the same design system as the rest of the application:

- Glass morphism effects
- Gradient backgrounds
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Dark theme optimized
